# Notes from Ali and Andy's meeting with Katie Menke

## Some Dates
- __April 2nd__: Around 1-4:30PM there is an event in Alumni Arena that Katie said will have an equipment setup very similar to ours. She says we will likely be able to test our system during this time.
- __April 6th__: pretty much the same as above
- __May 12th__: Engineering ceremony rehearsal. I think around 1PM. We can use this time as well.

## Audio Stuff
Katie mentioned some options including XLR and line level 1/4" outputs. After looking at the hardware on the Raspberry Pi spec sheets she said it's possible to use an adapter for 3.5mm to 1/4", and then probably pre-amplify it to sound good over their system

## Her Preferences
It seemed important to her that the name announcing synced up well with the graduates being on one of the two cameras (either the one showing the queue or the one showing the handshake line). This alters the logistics we currently have in mind, but not too much. Christine will have further opinions on this.

She mentioned her objective to ensure that the whole ceremony go smoothly, including the use of our system, so it seems that she'll be very willing to help where necessary. She was also adamant about having a backup system in place in case ours fails.
